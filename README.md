## This was a challange
## I think the first part was kind of easy
## Creating the game for the human to guess 
## But the interactions within classes and modules was hard
## Harder when I created the computer strategy
## But in the end the game is finish
## I could have give the computer more intelligence
## But I think it would be unfair, because you cant beat it
## So I made it in a way that you can win, but it depends in your good luck
